## Current Phase

**Phase:** Bug Fixes & Feature Enhancements
**Started:** 2025-01-27 (Session 11)
**Status:** 🟢 Active Development

**Focus:** Resolving compound prompt bugs, implementing soft delete functionality, improving UI/UX

**Session 11 Accomplishments:**
- Fixed compound prompts not showing previews on browse page
- Fixed infinite loop error in CompoundPromptBuilder component
- Implemented complete soft delete/archive system for prompts
- Repositioned sort dropdown to align with view mode toggles

## Active Tasks

**In Progress:** None - All requested features implemented

**Session 11 Completed Tasks:**
- [✅] Fixed compound prompts not showing previews (fallback to resolved_text)
- [✅] Fixed infinite loop in CompoundPromptBuilder (useRef initialization tracker)
- [✅] Implemented soft delete API endpoint with audit logging
- [✅] Added delete button to prompt edit form (two-step confirmation)
- [✅] Added deleted prompts section to admin dashboard with restore
- [✅] Repositioned sort dropdown alongside view mode toggles
- [✅] Committed changes (2 commits: soft delete + UI improvement)
- [✅] Updated comprehensive documentation (SESSIONS.md, STATUS.md)

**Recent Commits:**
- `f7570db` - Reposition sort dropdown below the line with view mode toggles
- `c7135a9` - Add soft delete functionality and fix compound prompt issues

**Next Session Priorities:**
- Address any issues discovered in production
- Await next feature requests from user

## Blockers & Decisions

**Current Blockers:**

- None

**Recent Decisions:**

- **Authentication:** Email/password via NextAuth.js v5 (avoid Google OAuth approval)
- **Session Strategy:** JWT tokens (required for Credentials provider)
- **Password Security:** Bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **Content License:** CC0 (Public Domain) for all submissions
- **Moderation:** Manual review for all submissions (small scale)
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 16, React 19, PostgreSQL 17, Prisma 7, Vercel

**Pending Decisions:**

- UI component library specifics
- Sign-up form validation rules
- Email verification for new accounts (Phase 2+)

## Work In Progress

**Current Task:** None - Project in Maintenance Mode

**Maintenance Mode Status:**

Project entering long-term hiatus with comprehensive documentation complete. All critical and high-priority code quality issues resolved. Ready for return at any time with full context preservation.

**Recent Session Focus (Session 16):**

Fixed M2 - Type hierarchy inconsistency in BasePrompt type. Added optional metadata fields (title, slug) to serve both minimal resolution scenarios and rich debugging contexts without type proliferation.

**Key Mental Model from Session 16:**

**Type System Philosophy - Optional Fields vs Type Proliferation:**

When a type serves multiple use cases with different field requirements, prefer optional fields over creating multiple similar types (YAGNI principle).

BasePrompt serves two contexts:
1. **Minimal resolution:** Core algorithm needs only id, prompt_text, is_compound, max_depth
2. **Rich debugging:** Import/export and error handling benefit from title, slug metadata

Solution: Made title/slug optional with comprehensive JSDoc explaining which fields are required vs optional. This avoids:
- Type proliferation (BasePrompt, BasePromptWithMetadata, etc.)
- Code duplication across similar types
- Breaking changes to existing resolution code
- Forces metadata where it's not needed

Benefits:
- Single source of truth for prompt data structure
- Backward compatible through optionality
- Better error messages when metadata is included
- Clean separation between core logic and debugging info

**Project State:**
- Git status: Clean (all changes committed and pushed)
- Recent commits: 3 commits from Session 16 (M2 fix, tests, code review update)
- Tests: All passing (75 total)
- Build: Production build verified
- Code review: 1 medium + 2 low priority issues remain (non-blocking)

- Start dev server: `npm run dev -- -p 3001`
- Run tests to verify everything works: `npm test`

**Priority 2:** Review remaining code quality issues (Optional)
- M1 - Type safety for compound component relationships (Medium priority)
- L1 - Test coverage for import/export service (Low priority)
- L2 - Edge case handling for circular dependencies (Low priority)
- See artifacts/code-reviews/session-14-review.md for details

**Priority 3:** Feature development or launch preparation
